# Changelog

## [v1.0.0-beta07]

Breaking Changes:
* This release contains a fundamental change in how you define your IDs
  * For details see [the related issue](https://github.com/andrewlock/StronglyTypedId/issues/102), the [PR](https://github.com/andrewlock/StronglyTypedId/pull/117), or the [README](./README.md)
  * The "options" enums `StronglyTypedIdBackingType`, `StronglyTypedIdConverter`, and `StronglyTypedIdImplementations` have been removed.
  * Instead, you simply choose one of 4 different built-in templates, or use a custom template.

Features
* Adds `[GeneratedCode]` attribute to generated IDs (Fixes https://github.com/andrewlock/StronglyTypedId/issues/57)
* Add support for parsing `SCOPE_IDENTITY()` and `@@IDENTITY` in MSSQL with `DapperTypeHandler` (Fixes https://github.com/andrewlock/StronglyTypedId/issues/118)
* Fix exception being thrown when deserializing nullable strongly-typed id backed by string (Fixes https://github.com/andrewlock/StronglyTypedId/issues/83)
* Allow creating multiple IDs with the same name in a project (Fixes https://github.com/andrewlock/StronglyTypedId/issues/74, [thanks @jo-goro](https://github.com/andrewlock/StronglyTypedId/pull/77)!)

## [v1.0.0-beta06]

Features
* Added support for Masstransit.NewId ([thanks @Khitiara](https://github.com/andrewlock/StronglyTypedId/pull/52)!) Fixes https://github.com/andrewlock/StronglyTypedId/issues/51
* Added parameterless constructor to EF Core ValueConverts for compatibility with global conventions. Fixes https://github.com/andrewlock/StronglyTypedId/issues/50
* Added `#pragma warning disable 1591` to generated code to avoid warning CS1591. Fixes https://github.com/andrewlock/StronglyTypedId/issues/47


## [v1.0.0-beta05]

Breaking Changes:
* Removed StronglyTypedId.Attributes NuGet package.
* The attributes are no longer embed in your project by default, instead it will use the external dll. You can re-enable the embedding by setting `STRONGLY_TYPED_ID_EMBED_ATTRIBUTES`.

New Features:

* Improved approach to handling [InternalsVisibleTo] issues, by embedding the StronglyTypedId.Attributes.dll in the NuGet package directly.

## [v1.0.0-beta04]

New Features:

* Added support for IDs inside nested classes/records/structs (Fixes https://github.com/andrewlock/StronglyTypedId/issues/40)
 
## [v1.0.0-beta03]

Breaking Changes:

* Converted to use .NET 6's incremental source generators. This should provide performance improvements, but it requires using the .NET 6 SDK.

Bug fixes:

* Fixed problem deserializing nullable strongly-typed IDs with Newtonsoft.Json (https://github.com/andrewlock/StronglyTypedId/issues/36)

New Features:

* To support scenarios in which [InternalsVisibleTo] causes duplicate reference issues with the marker attributes, you can set the msbuild constant `STRONGLY_TYPED_ID_EXCLUDE_ATTRIBUTES` to exclude these from build output. You must then reference the StronglyTypedId.Attributes project as well, which contains the marker attributes.
* By default, the marker attributes are decorated with the `[Conditional]` attribute, so they will not appear on your IDs. If you need these to persist, define the msbuild constant `STRONGLY_TYPED_ID_USAGES`.

## [v1.0.0-beta02]

Bug fixes

* Adds auto-generated attributes and enums as `internal` to help avoid referencing issues

## [v1.0.0-beta01]

Version 0.x of this library used the helper library [CodeGeneration.Roslyn](https://github.com/AArnott/CodeGeneration.Roslyn) by [AArnott](https://github.com/AArnott), for build-time source generation. In version 1.x this approach has been completely replaced in favour of source generators, as these are explicitly supported in .NET 5+. As part of this change, there were a number of additional features added and breaking changes made.

Breaking Changes

* `StronglyTypedIds` namespace is required. In version 0.x of the library, the `[StronglyTypedId]` attribute was in the global namespace. In version 1.x, the attribute is in the `StronglyTypedIds` namespace, so you must add `namespace StronglyTypedIds;`.
* The properties exposed by `StronglyTypedIds` have changed: there is no longer a `generateJsonConverter` property. Instead, this is infered based on the `StronglyTypedIdConverters` flags provided.
* The `String` backing typed ID will throw if you call the constructor with a `null` value

New Features

* The attributes can now auto-generate additional converter types such as EF Core `ValueConverter` and Dapper `TypeHandler`, as described in [my blog posts](https://andrewlock.net/series/using-strongly-typed-entity-ids-to-avoid-primitive-obsession/). These are optional flags on the `converters` property.
* Made interface implementations (`IEquatable<T>` and `IComparable<T>` currently) optional. This is to potentially support additional interfaces in future versions.
* Added a `NullableString` backing type. Due to the behaviour of `struct`s in c#, the `String` backing type ID _may_ still be null, but you can't explicitly call the constructor with a null value. In contrast, you can do this with the `NullableString` backing type.
* Added a `[StronglyTypedIdDefaults]` attribute to set default values for all `[StronglyTypedId]` attributes in your project. This is useful if you want to customise all the attributes, for example, if you want to generate additional converters by default. You can still override all the properties of a `[StronglyTypedId]` instance.

Bug Fixes

* Some converters had incorrect implementations, such as in ([#26](https://github.com/andrewlock/StronglyTypedId/issues/24)). These have been addressed in version 1.x.
* Better null handling has been added for the `String` backing type, handling issues such as [#32](https://github.com/andrewlock/StronglyTypedId/issues/32).
* The code is marked as auto generated, to avoid errors such as #CS1591 as described in [#27](https://github.com/andrewlock/StronglyTypedId/issues/27)

](https://github.com/vebbo2))
